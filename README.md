🚀 Task-05 Completed: Weather App🌥️

💻I have completed Task-05 by Prodigy Infotech for my internship. In doing so, I created a Weather App that requests for real-time weather using a weather API, depending on either the current location of the user or a city name entered manually. The application shows weather in real time including temperature, weather condition, humidity and wind speed. 🌦️🌍

📚 What I Learned:

During this project, I got practical experience in:

🔹 API integration using fetch() in JavaScript
Dealing with JSON and updating the DOM on the fly
🔹 fetching user location using the browser geolocation
🔹 Responsive UI design with HTML & CSS
🔹 Improved understanding of real-time web applications
